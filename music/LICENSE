The music files, `Tetris.mp3` and `Tetris.ogg`, were
[downloaded](https://archive.org/details/TetrisThemeMusic) from the
internet archive. There is nothing on that page that indicates there is any
license attached to this file and it can be downloaded by anyone, so I decided
to add it to the repository.
